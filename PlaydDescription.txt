Play'd is an interactive and adaptive electronic play-cloth for young children (age 0-6). Inside the cloth, sensors and actuators are hidden through which the child can communicate with a programmable computer platform, also hidden within Play'd. Different interaction scenario's can be loaded onto this platform that can help the child's cognitive and motoric developement. Different modes are designed for different developement stages and Play'd is designed to 'grow' with the child. Play'd can also be used in a therapeutic setting where it can be used to both monitor and aid a child's developement.
